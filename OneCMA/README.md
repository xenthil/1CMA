OneCMA
======

OneCMA is an application where all the systems governed by CMA are integrated. It provides a secured role based authentication. 
There will be many application roles based on employee's day to day activities. When a person from any given department (say Health, Education, Road or Birth and Death management) logs into OneCMA, he would see the features/modules with respective to his department and role.
The higher officials of CMA would have access to all the modules and can generate any kind of report from any department. The reports can be exported as excel and PDF formats.
OneCMA is a bilingual application, which would support both English and Tamil.

Problem statement:

The regular activities of the staff of many departments are manual: (E.g., Health, Education, and Sanitization). Data are captured in registers and ledgers. It involves lot of human effort. Over the period, the data becomes huge and very difficult to maintain. It is also tough to get any report out of such a huge physical data. Such data are vulnerable and there is no security. It also affects the productivity of the employees. Such manual processes also affect the public people in servicing them.
